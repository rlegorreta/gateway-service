Microservice that acts as the unique access from the front-ends services to the back-end services.

The purpose to have a unique gateway access is for security purpose that is a common pattern in distributed
architectures, used to decouple the internal API from the clients (fornt-end).

Other purposes are for monitor and resilence.


## Introduction

We chose Spring Cloud Gateway to build a gateway-service and implement an API gateway. We improve resilence of the 
system by configuring circuit breaker with Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, defining rate limiters with Spring Data
Redis Reactive (where we store web sessions).

note: Vaadin flow and Hilla has its own mechanism for store web sessions, but in order to include rate limiters 
as a centralized component (i.e., for several micro-fonts) some how we repeat this functionality.

This microservice can have external access to the application running in a Kubernetes cluster by relying on the
Kubernetes Ingress API.

## Running on Docker Desktop

### Create the image manually

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

### Publish the image to GitHub manually

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage \
   --imageName ghcr.io/rlegorreta/gateway-service \
   --publishImage \
   -PregistryUrl=ghcr.io \
   -PregistryUsername=rlegorreta \
   -PregistryToken=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
```

### Publish the image to GitHub from the IntelliJ

To publish the image to GitHub from the IDE IntelliJ a file inside the directory `.github/workflows/commit-stage.yml`
was created.

To validate the manifest file for kubernetes run the following command:

```
kubeval --strict -d k8s
```

This file compiles de project, test it (for this project is disabled for some bug), test vulnerabilities running
skype, commits the code, sends a report of vulnerabilities, creates the image and lastly push the container image.

For detail information see `.github/workflows/commit-stage.yml` file.


### Run the image inside the Docker desktop

```
docker run \
    --net ailegorretaNet \
    -p 8071:8071 \
    -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local \
    gateway-service
```

Or a better method use the `docker-compose` tool. Go to the directory `ailegorreta-deployment/docker-platform` and run the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Run inside Kubernetes

### Manually

If we do not use the `Tilt`tool nd want to do it manually, first we need to create the image:

Fist step:

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Second step:

Then we have to load the image inside the minikube executing the command:

```
image load ailegorreta/gateway-service --profile ailegorreta 
```

To verify that the image has been loaded we can execute the command that lists all minikube images:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{..image}" | tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c\n
```

Third step:

Then execute the deployment defined in the file `k8s/deployment.yml` with the command:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/deplyment.yml
```

And after the deployment can be deleted executing:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/deplymengt.yml
```

Fourth step:

For service discovery we need to create a service applying with the file: `k8s/service.yml` executing the command:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yml
```

And after the process we can delete the service executing:

```
kubectl deltete -f k8s/service.yml
```

Fifth step:

If we want to use the project outside kubernetes we have to forward the port as follows:

```
kubectl port-forward service/config-service 8071:80
```

Appendix:

If we want to see the logs for this `pod` we can execute the following command:

```
kubectl logs deployment/config-service
```

### Using Tilt tool

To avoid all these boilerplate steps is much better and faster to use the `Tilt` tool as follows: first create see the
file located in the root directory of the proyect called `TiltFile`. This file has the content:

```
# Tilt file for config-service
# Build
custom_build(
    # Name of the container image
    ref = 'gategay-service',
    # Command to build the container image
    command = './gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName $EXPECTED_REF',
    # Files to watch that trigger a new build
    deps = ['build.gradle', 'src']
)

# Deploy
k8s_yaml(['k8s/deployment.yml', 'k8s/service.yml'])

# Manage
k8s_resource('config-service', port_forwards=['8071'])
```

To execute all five steps manually we just need to execute the command:

```
tilt up
```

In order to see the log of the deployment process please visit the following URL:

```
http://localhost:10350
```

Or execute outside Tilt the command:

```
kubectl logs deployment/gateway-service
```

In order to undeploy everything just execute the command:

```
tilt down
```

To run inside a docker desktop the microservice need to use http://confsrv:8072 path
